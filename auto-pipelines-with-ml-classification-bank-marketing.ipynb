    "In this project you will continue working with the Bank Dataset introduced in [Project 1: Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure](https://github.com/dpbac/Optimizing-an-ML-Pipeline-in-Azure).

Since changes in any files in the `source_directory` would trigger a re-upload of the snapshot, this helps keep the reuse of the step when there are no changes in the `source_directory` of the step.\n",
