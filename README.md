# Operationalizing Machine Learning with Azure

## Overview

In this second project of the **Udacity Nanodegree program Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure** we configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it.

As in the first project we use the `Bank Marketing dataset` which contains data collected during direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. 
This is a subset of the original public dataset available at [UCI Machine Learning repository]( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). In this website a detailed 
description of each feature can be found.

In the [first project]( https://github.com/dpbac/Optimizing-an-ML-Pipeline-in-Azure) the main goal was to Optimize an Azure ML pipeline Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a 
provided Scikit-learn model and compare it to an Azure AutoML run.

In this new project we go further and not only obtain the best model using Azure Automated ML, but we configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, 
and consume it.

The main steps performed in this project are:

1. Authentication
2. Automated ML Experiment
3. Deploy the best model
4. Enable logging 
5. Swagger Documentation
6. Consume model endpoints
7. Create and publish a pipeline





## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. 
An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. 
In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. 
For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 



## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

### Step 1: Authenticatication

It was not necessary to perform this step since this project was developed using the VM provided by Udacity. 

By using the lab provide by Udacity, we are not authorized to create a security principal.

### Step 2: Automated ML Experiment





## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
